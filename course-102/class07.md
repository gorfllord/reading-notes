What is control flow?

> Control Flow is the order that code activates and operates. Code will run from top to bottom within a JavaScript file.

What is a JavaScript function?

> A JavaScript Function is a premade subroutine of sorts. You can set your function and any parameters it might want to work with and make a shorthand so you only have to code it once. Then you can reuse it by declaring its summoning word (like fetchSpell() or areTheyAMatch(Jim, Pam) )

What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

> It means you've called out to the Tech Elder Gods to hone your Tech Warlock Powers to... basically namedrop a function that has been defined inside of your code to then use it. If there's a parameter, you can define with variables you're working with in the parentheses that follow (like areTheyAMatch(Dwight, Angela) or isItOdd(4) )
It's ***MAGIC***

What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

> The parentheses encapsulate the variables that will be fed into the function, like say you wrote an algorhythm to rate possible romantic combinations from The Office, you could feed the function two parameters, like areTheyAMatch(Michael, Toby) so that the function will evaluate and return something given the parameters you gave it. In this case the function would return an unequivocal "NO"
