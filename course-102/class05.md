# Designing Web Pages with CSS

What is the purpose of CSS?

> CSS allows you to add style and pizazz to the site structure you've made with html. I guess to consolodate it into one word, I'd opt for "presentation" to html's "stucture"

What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

> You can add it inline into your html as a "style" attribute, externally as its own stand-alone .css file, or even just included as intermingling code in your html file if you use the \<style> tag to contain it.

Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.

> p {
>    
>   color: red;
>
> }
