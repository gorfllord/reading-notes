# Structuring Web Pages with HTML

### What is HTML and why do we use it?

> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it's a coding language for webpage structure and content.

### What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

> An HTML element has 3 main parts, an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

### What is it called when you give an element extra information?

> HTML elements can also have attributes which might grant some more specificity or make some style changes to the HTML element in question.

### What is a semantic element?

> Semantic elements are elements where the meaning of the code is built into the tag. For example, \<header>\</header> gives you a header, \<main>\</main> establishes what is the main part of the page, \<figure>\</figure> allows you to insert a figure.
> 
> Another good example is thinking through what it is you're trying to show with the HTML. Say you're trying to list some things in no particular order, so you would use an unordered list. There's a semantic element for that! it's \<ul>\<li>Item 1\</li>\<li>Item 2\<li>\</ul> where the 'ul' stands for 'unordered list' and 'li' stands for 'list item'.
