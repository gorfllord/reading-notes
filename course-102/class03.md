# Revisions and the Cloud

What is Version Control?

> Version Control is a way to keep track of edits and changes to files, especially in a shared directory when working with others. Specifically the perk is to be able to revisit older versions in case you need to revert to a previous iteration.

What is cloning in Git?

> Cloning is taking the repo from the cloud and copying it locally so that you can edit files on your own device, then add-commit-push (ACP) back to the cloud when appropriate.

What is the command to track and stage files?

> 'git add \<filename>' or 'git add .' will add files to the index where files will be tracked and staged.

What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

> 'git commit' is the command to "snapshot" your file, queueing in the most recent version to prepare it to upload

What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

> 'git push' is the basic command, 'git push origin main' is the command with a context provided, in this case the location for my currently github setup.
