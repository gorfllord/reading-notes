What are variables in JavaScript?

> Variables store information to be recalled later. They can be numbers, text, or even numbers AS text.

What does it mean to declare a variable?

> Declaring a variable conjures it into existance, as far as your javascript file is concerned. It defines the name you assign to the variable as a thing to be stored and recalled later, that way when you recall the variable, it knows what name to look for.

What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

> The assignment operator allows you to define the value of a variable, so x = 6, the "=" is assigning x the value of 6. textThing = "Snarky Comment Here" is assigning the string of text "Snarky Comment Here" to the variable textThing. One important thing to note is that "=" does not mean "is equal to" like you might expect in math, that operator is instead ==, therefor if you wanted a function to add 5 to the current value of a variable, you could write that function as "x = x + 5" and it would add 5 to the current value and store the new value as x.

What is information received from the user called?

> Input is what we call the information we receive from the user, where as output is the information we return to the user, often times in response to input we are receiving from the user, after it gets stored and processed.
