# Text Editors
## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
>The four important features mentioned in the article are Code Completion, Syntax Highlighting, A Variety of Themes, and a Healthy Selection of Extensions. Code completion will save you from the extra keystrokes, which can add up over time. Syntax highlighting helps you keep track of what you're doing by color coding different syntax. Themes give you the ability to choose which layout might give you the least amount of eye strain after a long session of coding. Extensions give you the utility and flexibility to do all the things you might need to.

## What do the following commands do?

    1. 'pwd'
    
>Print Working Directory, which tells you which directory you're currently in

    2. 'ls'
    
>List what is in your current directory

    3. 'cd'
    
>Change your current directory to whatever follows, or if it's 'cd' by itself, change to the root directory.

    4. 'mkdir'
    
>Make directory, whatever follows will be the name of the directory

    5. 'touch'
    
>Create an empty file or a range of files if you're feeling spicy. ex. 'touch class02.md' creates an empty markdown file named class02 (oh hey it's how I made this one). You can also do 'touch class{01..10}.md' if you want to make a series of files with that particular number array.

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

    1. 'cd projects'
    
>You've now changed directories to the projects directory in whichever directory you were just in.

    2. 'mkdir new-project'
    
>You've now made a directory called new-project inside of the directory you're currently working in

    3. 'touch new-project/newfile.md'
    
>You've now made a file called newfile.md inside of the new-project directory.

    4. 'cd ..'
    
>You've changed directories to the next directory higher in your tree of directories (the one containing the directory you were just in)

    5. 'ls projects/new-project'
    
>List the contents of the new-project directory inside of the projects directory
