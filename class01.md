1. What is Markdown?
2. Why do we use Markdown?
    >So Markdown is a quick and efficient way of providing content for a webpage or similar text displaying platform that allows you to focus on the contents instead of getting bogged down on the style, utilizing simpler syntax to convey basic text organization like headings, bold and italic text, lists, hyperlinks, and block quotes. It's pretty platform agnostic, so it's good to go for most things you'll encounter out there in the world.
3. What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
    - How many do you need to create the largest heading?
    - How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
    >A single # gets you the biggest heading, all the way down to six #'s to get you the smallest. Make sure you have a space between the # and the text!
    >
    >(ex. ###### This is a sixth level heading.)
4. When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
    >While there are multiple options for bold and italic denotation, the * is the most widely accepted across platforms, so \*this is italic,* \*\*this is bold,** and \*\*\*this is bold AND italic.***
5. How do you create a link with Markdown?
    >Creating a hyperlink is using \[The text you want to be the link](http://thesiteyouwa.nt) links to an external site. One important detail is to not put a space between the square brackets and the parentheses. I made that mistake once already, NEVER AGAIN
6. What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
    >If you want an unordered list, you can use *, -, or + to use as your bullet points. You can even use them to have a sub-list within your numbered list if you're feeling spicy :)
