# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### HTML

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

> Wrap that text in an anchor tag with an href!

The href attribute contains what information?

> The href contains the URL that will be the destination of the link.

What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

> Be clear and precise about the text you throw in the anchor tag. Screen Readers might pull the link out of context, and it's not very helpful if you don't know where it intends to take you. 

### CSS Layout

What is meant by “normal flow”?

> "normal flow" is essentially the default setting before any CSS has been applied.

What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

> Block-level elements will fill the available space of the container element, like an image that might scale up if you make a window larger. Inline elements will have a static size that is either the default, or whatever you've assigned that attribute through CSS.
>Also, block-level elements will stack vertically when multiple are in a row, whereas inline elements will default to being horizontally adjacent to the previous element.

___ positioning is the default for every html element.

> Static

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

> Absolute positioning is great if you have an element that you don't want to affect or be affected by the positioning of other elements, like a pop-up information box, or a rollover panel in a nav-bar or something.

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

> Fixed position will stay in the same position relative to the window, no matter if you scroll. Absolute positioning will stay in the same position relative to the page, so it'll move if/when you scroll.

### JavaScript

Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

> A function declaration is where you define that it exists and what it will do. An invocation is when you use that function to run the code within. 

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

> A parameter is information you're feeding to the function by way of putting it in the paratheses of the function name, like getCheese(gouda) will run the getCheese function and will plug in gouda where appropriate (presumably the target cheese of the fetch quest). Argument is just another word for parameter, I imagine the wording will depend on what the function is doing with the supplied information.

### Miscellaneous

Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

> Right off the bat, Learning From Fellow Students is a great example of a benefit of pair programming. We do it in class with the instructor sometimes, but also in lab it's a great way to help someone learn if they're the driver and you're navigating. But also it can help solidify what the code is actively doing if you're navigating while someone else is driving.
> Work Environment Readiness is another great benefit, as the experience I've heard from everyone I know in the industry is that everything is very collaborative. Most of the time you'll be working in teams and getting used to working together right from the get-go is a great way to start (unlike UW who teaches you that you're in it alone and forbids working together, at least in the java class I took. Yikes! I pedagogically disagree with their methods.)
