# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

### HTML

When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

> An unordered list is great when you have things in no particular order, like if you just want bullet points to get your point across.

How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

> Ideally, use CSS to change the 'list-style-type' attribute to either circle, disc, or square.

When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

> An ordered list is great if you want a numbered list, like if you want things to be specifically sequential in how they're presented.

Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

> Preferably using CSS, you can change the 'list-style-type' to be '1' for numbers, the default, 'a' for lowercase letters, 'A' for uppercase, 'i' for roman numerals, or 'I' for uppercase roman numerals. You can also use the attribute 'start' to start on a number/letter other than the default 1/A
