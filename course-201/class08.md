### Learn CSS - Flexbox

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

> It's takes in just one direction, the main axis, when arranging items. Really what this mostly translates to is that it won't arrange things in a grid, as that would be one-dimensional, but it'll arrange things in a straight line.

Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

> The main axis is the primary direction things are moving, usually left to right. The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, often times top to bottom. If you're working in a column orientation, these can flip. Think of main as your primary direction and cross axis as...the other one?

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

> If you've changed the ordering that things show up or set it to display in reverse order, screen readers and such will still read things in logical order from the html document, not the order you've set through the flexbox, so it can get possibly confusing or those using those methods will wind up getting that information in the wrong order based on how it's being displayed.

### CSS Layout - Flexbox

What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

> flexbox can help reign in some of the quirks that float can bring. Plus it still lets you organize things relative to other objects in it's parent container, which itself can still be set relative to other objects on the page.

How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

> Sometimes you need to know how to make things look good if you've building a website or even probably building a shell for a stand-alone program. If I have to design the layout myself, great direct usage. If I'm designing the code and someone else is designing the page, it's useful to know how my code might be implemented by a designer so I can build my page with that in mind. Super-immediately-directly, I'm the webmaster for a music education non-profit, so if I need to change a layout on our website, I got the skillz now.
