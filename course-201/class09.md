# Forms and JS Events

# HTML Forms

Why are forms so important in web development?

> Forms let you take input from the user.

When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

> You want to make sure you use semantic elements like label and use their name property to make sure the context in clear and concise, that way screen reader users can have the label read to them to specify the input that is desired. Also if you specify the the input in the label, if you click the label text it will select the corresponding input. Especially useful for things like radio buttons.

List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

> label will tack on a label to tell the user what the input requested is; input is the part where the user can input their response, be it text or radio button or check box or whatever input type you've utilized; button is great for having a submit button, you can just specify the 'submit' type, and as long as within the form tag, it should do the trick; textarea is an alternative to the input element, where input is a void element textarea is not, so the way you can define default text is different; the fieldset element allows you to group answers together, like if you have multiple options with radio buttons, that way the one you choose will return properly from the context you desire.
