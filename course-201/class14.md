### CSS Transforms

What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

> CSS Transform allows us to morph elements to different shapes and sizes, though mostly still 4-sided shapes.

Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

> You could use it to draw the user's eye to something, like maybe a button to take them somewhere, or maybe if you're making a diagram of something and a slightly angled box better suits the point you're trying to convey. Maybe you want to emulate a street sign in more of a diamond-shape by rotating a square 45 degrees? Otherwise the options are boundless for the rad stylez.

### CSS Transitions & Animations

What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

> A transition allows the developer to essentially animate the transition between states when the CSS code changes. You can have something change colors on hover and have the transition between colors fade instead of being instantaneous.

How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

> Animation allows for more control over more moving parts, transitions will just work for individual properties.

# Psychological Safety

What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

> Communication, Empathy, and Sensitivity are kind of the key things, though trust is kind of a part of that too.

Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

> Well, I had a toxic work environment that I quit because our team didn't work together well and certain people chose to be bitter and vindictive when things didn't go their way. When they were having a bad day, they exuded that negative energy and made the workplace an emotional minefield. In this case, not a lot of psychological safety, if any at all.
>
> Contrast that to another work environment where I would occasionally have anxiety attacks at work and my manager was open, accepting, and vulnerable when discussing and working through how we might work around that road block.

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

> They're more productive, more succesful, and in the end, more profitable for the company. Also it winds up being a better, healthier work environment for team members.
