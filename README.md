### So What Are We Talking About Here?

So the **Growth Mindset** is more or less a mindset that is committed to growth. I know, I know, I used to the words of the thing to define the thing, but hear me out:

The idea is to frame your experiences and your potential struggle in learning, developing, or working together to work toward a collective goal of growth and personal and collective betterment. If you have a *fixed* mindset, you're much more likely to coast through things and over time might start to feel stagnant in a field and industry that is perpetually growing and reinventing itself. If you approach the world and your experiences as an experience to learn something, you will find you will be more successful in personal, intersocial, and business endeavors because you'll wind up with more tools and ideas in your skillset to grow as a person and as a developer.

So here's some reminders for yourself:

1. Always Be Learning
    - Reflect on success moments and failure moments
    - Reflect on any criticism you might receive and don't reflexively shut it down or ignore it
2. Allow yourself take pride in what you're doing
    - Effort comes easier if you're filled with passion and gusto
    - Also make sure to take some breaks to not burn out
3. Help others grow and take pride in their own work
    - Sometimes helping others makes it easier to help yourself :)
