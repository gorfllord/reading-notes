# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

What is a “component”?

> A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exported it as a higher-level interface, to quote the reading. Essentially it's external code that you can bring in to utilize it's functionality if you don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every time you need to use specific code for certain functionality.

What are the characteristics of a component?

> Reusability, Replaceable, Not context specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, Independant. Mostly it looks like you want it to be modular so you can import it into a project when you need without needed to worry about prepping much. You just need to bring the file in and you're good to go.

What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

> Ease of Deployment, Reduced Cost, Ease of Development, Reusable, Modification of Technical Complexity, Reliability, System Maintenance and Evolution, Independant.
> Which, again, why reinvent the wheel every time when you can make something once and make it available for everything else you need it for later to use?
